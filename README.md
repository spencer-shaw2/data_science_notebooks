# üèà Geospatial Analysis of Missed Tackles in the NFL
*This notebook is a final submission to the 'NFL Big Data Bowl 2024' Kaggle competition. This competition used data collected by AWS Next Gen Stats to challenge the way traditional statistics analyze tackling in the NFL. In this notebook, an in-depth analysis of the quality of missed tackles is evaluated using player tracking data. IMPORTANT: Due to data access restrictions after the completion of competitions, the notebook is not in GitHub but hosted on Kaggle.*

**Recognition:**
  * ü•â: Bronze medal awarded on the Kaggle platform for number of upvotes.

# üìä Machine Learning Model Explainability
*This notebook demonstrates techniques used to understand* **how** *machine learning models make predictions. Although this notebook is not focused on searching for the best predictions for this dataset, there are some techniques used to achieve a good fit.*

**NOTE:** To skip down to the model explainability portion of the notebook, please scroll down to the *"Model 1.1: Linear Regression with Reduced Features"* header.

You can download both the dataset and the notebook to run on your local machine!

# Deploying Custom üçï Pizza/ü•© Steak CNN Using Gradio
*This project was a fun way to learn the architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in Tensorflow and also understanding how each layer works. Using an image dataset from Kaggle to train a neural network from scratch, not only is it ~88% accurate in rightly predicting images of pizza versus steak, but the model was also embedding into an application using Gradio and deployed on a hugging face space for **YOU** to try.*
